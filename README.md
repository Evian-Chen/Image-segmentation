# U-Net-segmentation
## Overview
This is a samll practice of image segmentation using U-Net architecture.

## Dataset

## Methodology
* Build a double convolution network for U-Net.
* Build U-Net structure model for training later.
* Build a custom dataloader for loading data. Since the original dataset is too large, only 1600 images is uploaded to the google drive.
* Train the model.
